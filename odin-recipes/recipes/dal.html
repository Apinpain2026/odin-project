      The flavors of Indian food are very diverse -- in North India families use
      a lot of dairy, wheat, and cumin seeds, whereas in South India (which is
      more coastal) food is often flavored with coconut milk, curry leaves, and
      mustard seeds. This one-pot dal is absolutely bursting with South Indian
      flavors like curry leaves, mustard seeds, and coconut milk. My family
      enjoys eating it with some steamed basmati rice.
